# Why We Created rulesctl

## Problem Statement

We frequently encountered the following inconveniences during development:

1. **Repetitive Rule Creation**
   - For each new project start (POC, MVP, prototype, etc.)
   - Need to repeatedly create similar rules for the same tech stack
   - Duplicate time and effort investment

2. **Difficulty in Rule Management**
   - Rules are scattered across different projects
   - Version control of rules is challenging
   - Sharing rules with team members is cumbersome

3. **Inefficiency in Rule Application**
   - Manual copying required when applying existing rules to new projects
   - Updates must be manually applied to all projects
   - Maintaining rule consistency is difficult

4. **Deployment Challenges**
   - Complex deployment of Go-based CLI tools across platforms
   - Manual installation process required for each user
   - Version management and updates are cumbersome

## Solution

rulesctl provides the following features to address these issues:

1. **Centralized Rule Management**
   - Rule repository using GitHub Gist
   - Manage all rules in one place
   - Automatic version control and backup

2. **Easy Rule Sharing**
   - Intuitive rule upload/download via CLI
   - Easy rule sharing with team members
   - Rule description and metadata management

3. **Efficient Rule Application**
   - Instant download and application of desired rule sets
   - Maintain directory structure while managing rules
   - Conflict detection and automatic resolution

4. **NPM-based Distribution System**
   - Easy installation through NPM (`npm install -g rulesctl`)
   - Automatic binary selection by platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
   - Automatic update mechanism

## Expected Benefits

   - Time saved in rule creation/management
   - Immediate rule application when starting projects
   - Enhanced development speed for the entire team

2. **Enhanced Rule Quality**
   - Consistency through centralized management
   - Easy continuous improvement and version control
   - Unified coding standards across the team

3. **Increased Collaboration Efficiency**
   - Simplified rule sharing and application
   - Automated rule synchronization between team members
   - Easy maintenance of rule consistency across projects

4. **Improved Tool Usability**
   - Easy installation and updates through NPM
   - Platform-compatible deployment process
