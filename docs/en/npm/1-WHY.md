# Why We Chose NPM

## Problem Statement

We encountered the following challenges in deploying and managing rulesctl:

1. **Platform Compatibility Issues**
   - Need to deploy Go-based CLI tool across multiple platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
   - Separate builds and tests required for each platform
   - Complex manual installation process for each user

2. **Version Management Difficulties**
   - Difficult to deliver tool updates to users
   - Manual version checking and updating required
   - Cumbersome compatibility management with previous versions

3. **Installation Process Complexity**
   - Different installation methods needed for each platform
   - Dependency management is challenging
   - Additional environment configuration required after installation
