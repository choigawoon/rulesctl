# 명령어 실행해야할 때 규칙
- 실행전 반드시 현재 디렉토리를 먼저 확인하는 명령어를 실행하고, 진행

# README.md Rules

- README.md is for the user
- Clearly explain the problem this tool solves and why it matters — the user should immediately understand the value
- Start with a short Problem → Solution section
- Follow with a Usage section using clear examples (e.g., installation, CLI commands)
- End with a Contribution section, but keep it short — link to `docs/GET-STARTED.md` for full contributor onboarding
- You can use markdown for formatting, but it's optional — clarity and consistency come first
